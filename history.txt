    + single click: fold

* POSITION is chosen right if dropped onto root. (left half, pasted to left, right half, pasted to - you guess it? - right!)
* Left and Right is respected with ENTER.
* Bug fix: cutting nodes including any of their children or grant-children works now. This removes the bug with a moved tree that is completely marked.

----
* Bug fix: nodes with arc and bubble nodes have antialiased text when the antialiasing  of edges is on
